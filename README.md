A missing feature in Billomat is to download an invoice in the overview of all invoices. This tool helps to do exactly that.

All you have to do is to insert your API key, which is locally stored on your machine. You can also go ahead and try out the tool at [http://billomat.sinther.net/](http://billomat.sinther.net/).

It is based on yeoman, AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap. Project scaffolding was done via 
`yo angular` [https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular).

### Build
To build the project open a Terminal and typ
`grunt build`
